# Catalog of dynamical and control systems

Created in the scope of a scientific thesis at the Institute of Control Theory, TU Dresden.

Prototype for a catalog of control systems, which contains:
- a written description of the models in folder 01_Models
- (sometimes) a implemented form of the models in folder 02_Implementations
- templates for the creation of new models
- a classification system for model related attributes to classify the models in their metadata file

For further information reach out to CKnoll from the TU Dresden.
